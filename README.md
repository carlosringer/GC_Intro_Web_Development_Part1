### Grand Circus Detroit   
@CarlosRinger

#### `Week 1` - April 12 & 14
### Attributes
- key/value pairs is an important concept in programming
- attributes must be in quotations  
`<div class= "containers">A bunch of stuff</div>`

### Doctype
`<!doctype html>`
- very first element when writing HTML file  
- backwards compatible
- tells the browser how it should render page

### Main HTML Tags
`head` Contains the page title and metadata
`body` Contains all of the visible content
`title` Optional tag. This is the name of your page. Nested in the `head` tag

### Nesting
HTML elements 'nest' inside one another. The element that opens first closes last

### Content Tags
`div` defacto container element  
`p` used for copy  
`h1 thru h6` designating titles/subtitles  
`ol` create a numbered list  
`ul` create an unordered list  
`li` list elements

### Links
#### Anchor element
links to other sites on the web (or within your project) are created using this element  
`<a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>`  
`<a href="about.html">About Me</a>`

#### Link element
Unlike the `link` species relationships between the current document and an external resource

### HTML Comments
Ignored by the browser engine. Able to comment on code like any other coding language  

`<!-- Hello, I am a comment. -->`

### Tables
Tables are a way to represent complex information in a grid format
- made of rows and columns  
- tables are compound elements
- don't use tables to style content, thats why we have CSS!

### Folder Structure
